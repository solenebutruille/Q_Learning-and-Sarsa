My environnement is implemented is gym-foo. 
To launch it, with sarsa or q-learning, you can just go in the code and change the algorithm parameter to
"Sarsa" or "Q-Learning". 

To launch Sarsa_Lambda, you can modify the lambda parameter at first in the parameters.
But they might be a mistake in the code, beacause we can see in the graph that it doesn't seem to learn anything. 
As I struggled a lot to implement sarsa-lambda, I took the code from :

And I tried to understand and adapt it.
